			<h3>Communication gets easier...</h3>
			<h2>For everyone.</h2>

			<p>
				According to the Canadian Association for the Deaf, approximately 3.6% of the population can understand and communicate in American Sign Language. For deaf Canadians who primarily communicate through American Sign Language (ASL), the primary language for the culturally deaf, day-to-day communication that hearing individuals often take for granted can be challenging.
				<br /><br />
				To address this issue, we developed Voxio, a tool designed to streamline communication for hard-of-hearing and Deaf individuals. Unlike the cumbersome nature of typing or writing responses, Voxio utilizes real-time ASL transcription and text-to-speech technology to facilitate a natural flow of conversation, mirroring the ease of physical interactions.

			<h2>How it Works</h2>
			<div class="feature">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<h3 align="right">ASL Transcription Feature</h3>
						<p> The user signs to the camera built into the glasses. with computer vision technology, 
							The sign language is interpreted into text and is read aloud via the speaker. 
							This feature can be turned off for users that do not use ASL to communicate.
						</p>

						<h3>Raspberry Pi Module</h3>
						<p> The module, designed to fit in the user's pocket, securely contains the Raspberry Pi that controls all of Voxio's 
							features.

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>For the future of Voxio, we want to implement a subtitle feature. This would consist of a microphone built into Voxio that detects
				 speech, transfer it to text and display the text onto an OLED screen that would rotate down into the glasses view.
			</p>
			<p>Originally, we wanted to implement this feature which is why there is an OLED screen and motor featured on the CAD design. 
				However, we focused on making something that could improve means of communication with the culturally Deaf. One of the primary 
				forms of communication for culturally Deaf people in Canada is ASL so we prioritized our computer vision feature to translate ASL
				 to speech.
