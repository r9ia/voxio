			<h3>Communication gets easier...</h3>
			<h2>For everyone.</h2>

			<p>
				According to the Canadian Association for the Deaf, approximately 3.6% of the population can understand and communicate in American Sign Language. For deaf Canadians who primarily communicate through American Sign Language (ASL), the primary language for the culturally deaf, day-to-day communication that hearing individuals often take for granted can be challenging.
				<br /><br />
				To address this issue, we developed Voxio, a tool designed to streamline communication for hard-of-hearing and Deaf individuals. Unlike the cumbersome nature of typing or writing responses, Voxio utilizes real-time ASL transcription and text-to-speech technology to facilitate a natural flow of conversation, mirroring the ease of physical interactions.
